# PostgreSQL
Contains various database examples(table creation, querying, triggers) in PostgreSQL.

Assignment 1:  
Example of database creation (DDL) involving university structures. A Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) was first created in order to visually map out    various entity relations in a university. Then the each table in the ERD was created in PostgreSQL. Concepts such as Multiplicity (many to many/many to one),participation (partial/total), and weak entity sets were stressed.

Assignment 2:  
Provides various examples of querying a database. The CreateTable.ddl creates the tables in the database and the loadData.ddl populates the database with data. Query.dml contains the queries. The ERD is also provided for visual reference.

Assignment 3:  
An example of trigger creation is provided for the database in Assignment 2.
